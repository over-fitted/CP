Divider:
Binary Search question
create a helper to whether people can be divided into x groups with max noise level of y
binary search for lowest max noise level threshold
calculate total noise level with searched threshold


ShopeeTaman:
Recursive Backtracking + Dynamic Programming

Recursive backtracking section:
create function f with 2D array input containing fruit values of each day
maintain state with the following:
    which side are you on
    result thus far
    which day it is
calculate the highest possible value of staying on your side (prefixSumMax) and value of crossing to other side (prefixSum last ele)
return max(f(fruits, day + 1, result + sameSide, currentSide), f(fruits, day + 1, result + changeSide, otherSide))

DP section:
calculating value of staying and crossing is costly, so memoize it
create 2D memo containing StayingLeft, crossing, StayingRight
if Staying<side you are on> exists, use that value, else do the calculation for that step and memoize it
